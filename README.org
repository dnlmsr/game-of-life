* Introduction
This is basically [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life][Conway's Game of Life]], nothing really special.
This program was created by me to learn ncurses and some C and Makefile basics.
* Installation
Firstly, make sure gcc and make are installed, then run make inside the main directory:
#+begin_src bash
make
#+end_src
* Usage
Run ~gol~ inside the bin directory with an argument representing the path to the initial state:
#+begin_src bash
./bin/gol ./patterns/spaceship.gol
#+end_src
Then press any key to update to a newer generation. Press ~q~ to exit the game.
* Contributing
Although this is a very basic project, pull requests are welcome.
